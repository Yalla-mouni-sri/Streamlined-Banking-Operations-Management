💰 Deposits & Withdrawals: Secure transaction handling with data validation.

⚡ Fast Cash: Quick withdrawal options for predefined amounts.

📊 Balance Inquiry: Real-time account balance updates.

🔐 User Authentication: Login system with secure credential storage.

📂 Transaction History: Tracks all deposits, withdrawals, and account activities.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Java

Database: MySQL (via JDBC)

Concepts Used: OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism), DBMS

IDE/Tools: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse, Git, GitHub
